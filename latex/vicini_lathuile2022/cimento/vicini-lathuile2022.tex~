\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This sample paper is intended to briefly expose the differences
between a standard \LaTeX\ article and a paper based upon the
\texttt{cimento} class. References and equations are not allowed here. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Description}
This is a very short sample paper distributed with the class
\texttt{cimento}.
It is just a collection of examples about the syntax of commands
which behave in a different way from the standard \LaTeX
and/or new commands not defined in \LaTeX.

This sample is not meant to provide the complete documentation for the class.
You can also use this file as a template for your own paper:
copy it to another filename and then modify as needed.

\subsection{Tables}
Table~\ref{tab:pricesI}
inserted at this point.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Prices of important items.}
  \label{tab:pricesI}
  \begin{tabular}{rcl}
    \hline
      Item 1      & 1500  & EUR    \\
      Item 2 & 15000 & EUR    \\

\subsection{Mathematics}
Here is a lettered array~(\ref{e.all}), with eqs.~(\ref{e.house})
and~(\ref{e.phi}):
\begin{eqnletter}
 \label{e.all}
 \drm x_\sy{F} & = & 1.2\cdot10^3\un{cm}, \qquad
                     \tx{where\ } \sy{F} = \tx{Fermi}    \label{e.house}\\
 \phi_i        & = & i\pi                                \label{e.phi}
\end{eqnletter}

\subsection{Citations}
We're almost done, just some citations~\cite{ref:apo}
and we will be over~\cite{ref:pul,ref:bra}.
