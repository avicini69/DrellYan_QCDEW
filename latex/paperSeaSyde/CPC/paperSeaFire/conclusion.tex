\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The solution via series expansion of multi-loop Feynman integrals has received a renewed attention after the work of Ref.~\cite{Moriello:2019yhu} and the publication of the package \textsc{DiffExp} \cite{Hidding:2020ytt}.
The definition of the masses of the gauge bosons in the Complex-Mass-Scheme implies the need to evaluate multi-loop Feynman integrals with complex-valued internal massive lines and the latter could not be studied with the public version of \textsc{DiffExp}.
In this paper we have presented a new implementation of the series expansion method in the package \textsc{SeaSyde}, with an original algorithm to perform the analytic continuation of the results, in the whole complex plane of the kinematical invariants.
The usage of this package allows the consistent evaluation of two-loop and higher-order electroweak corrections to scattering processes of interest at the LHC and future colliders.
