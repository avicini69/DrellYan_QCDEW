The code presented in this paper solves 
the system of differential equations 
satisfied by the the Master Integrals.
The solution algorithm relies on five main remarks:
1) uniqueness of the analytic continuation;
2) explicit prescription for the independent variables, 
   which are in general complex valued;
3) identification of all the logarithmic singularity of the solution;
4) algorithmic assignment of the cuts associated to the logarithmic behaviour;
5) algorithmic identification of a simply connected path, 
   which connects the BC and evaluation points, avoiding all the cuts of point 4).
