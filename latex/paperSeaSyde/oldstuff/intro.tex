\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The paper is organised as follows.
In Section 2 we provide a pedagogical introduction to the solution
of a system of first order linear differential equations by series expansions.
In Section 3 we discuss a general procedure
to exploit the information available through the differential equation,
to identify the analytical structure of the solution.
We eventually present how we implement in practice the analytic continuation
with a one-loop example, comparing the real and complex mass cases.
In Section 4 we outline the implementation
in the \textsf{Mathematica} package \textsf{SeaFire}
of the algorithm that solves a generic system of differential equations,
for arbitrary complex-valued kinematical variables and weights.
We illustrate the different computational strategies available.
In Section 5 we discuss the solution of the Master Integrals needed to
evaluate the two-loop QCD-EW virtual corrections to the neutral-
and charged-current Drell-Yan processes.
The latter constitute an original result of this paper.
