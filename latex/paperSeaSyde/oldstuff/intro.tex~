\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The paper is organised as follows.
In Section 2 we provide a pedagogical introduction to the solution
of a system of first order linear differential equations by series expansions.
In Section 3 we discuss a general procedure
to exploit the information available through the differential equation.
We accordingly set the branch cuts
which uniquely define the first Riemann surface, making the solution
one-valued.
We comment on the differences emerging
with different choices of the branch cuts.
We eventually present how we implement in practice the analytic continuation
with few representative examples a one- and two-loop level.
In Section 4 we discuss the solution of the Master Integrals needed to
evaluate the two-loop QCD-EW virtual corrections to the neutral-
and charged-current Drell-Yan processes.
The latter constitute an original result of this paper.
