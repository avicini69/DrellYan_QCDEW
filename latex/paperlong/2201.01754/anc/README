bareNCDY.m : 
             It contains the unrenormalised matrix elements of the vertex and box corrections in terms of the MIs 
             with the corresponding rational coefficients schematically described in eq. (3.10).
             It is a list with two elements. The first element is the total contributions from \gamma\gamma subset 
             and the Feynman diagrams with a tree level Z propagator in the \gamma Z subset, which must be treated
             considering massive leptons, both in the kinematics and the IBP reductions.
             The second element is the total contributions from the rests. 
             Note that, it also contains the coupling constants.


NCDY_ME11.m : 
             It contains the IR subtracted and UV renormalised, matrix elements of the vertex and box corrections. 
             The subtraction of the IR poles has been performed using eq. (5.1). The self-energy contributions are
             separately UV finite and already available in the literature. Hence, they are not included here.
             the result is in terms of GPLs with argument 1 (one) & 27 symbols. The symbols denote ep coefficients
             of the 5 master integrals in eq. (5.2) for deifferent integral families B16z, B16zp and B16wp.  There
             are also symbols which denote the ep coefficient of the one-loop box integral with two massive lines.  
             
             The result has been presented in the small lepton mass limit i.e. all terms which vanish in the limit 
             ml -> 0, have been dropped. 


ME11_partml_exact.m :
             The part of the result ( the first element of bareNCDY.m ), which must be treated considering massive
             leptons, has been obtained with the exact dependence of the lepton mass.  We also present this result
             in    H11_partml_exact.m.


gridsth.m :  
             It contains our chosen set of values for the sqrt(s) and cos \theta.


uU_totaldelta_vertbox.dat :
             The grid contains the IR subtracted UV renormalised hard function 2*Re[<M0|M11fin>] due to the vertex 
             and box corrections present in NCDY_ME11.m, NORMALISED by <M0|M0> & also subtracted of the logarithms 
             of the lepton mass, for up-type quark initiated (u ubar) channel. 
             The numerical evaluation has been performed for 130x25 points in (sqrt(s), cos \theta). Note that, it
             has been expressed in units of (alpha/pi)*(alphas/pi).
