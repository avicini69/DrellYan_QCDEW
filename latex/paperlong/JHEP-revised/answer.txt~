Dear Editor,
we would like to thank the Referee for her/his comments,
which have been helpful to correct and improve the paper.
We answer in detail to all the points in the following.
We have implemented all the requested changes and
we hope that, with these modifications, the paper is now suitable
for publication on JHEP.


1. We thank the referee for pointing out a mistake of our writing.
In our calculation, we have computed explicitly and separately the uubar
and ddbar channels. We have performed the computation with two independent
codes generating the Feynman amplitudes and, after the relevant
manipulations, we found perfect agreement.

While describing the generation of the amplitude, we overlooked the
possible problem with the WW boxes and we gave a misleading recipe. We
have corrected the text specifying what we actually did.


2. We have corrected the text according to the request of the referee.

3. At page 7, we point the reader to ref.[79] for the complex mass scheme.

4. The question asked by the referee is twofold.

(a) The one-loop expressions have been generated in two completely
independent ways relying on QGRAF and on FeynArts, with perfect agreement,
separately for uubar and ddbar channels as already commented for point 1.

(b) When discussing the one-loop boxes, the relevance of the complex mass
scheme emerges, because of the presence of a threshold at 2*MV, MV being
the mass of the gauge boson (W or Z). We have expressed the one-loop
integrals in terms of GPLs or via A,B,C, and D scalar integral functions.
We have used GiNaC to evaluate the GPLs and Looptools for the A,B,C,D
scalar functions.
For the epsilon^0 contribution in dimensional regularization, we can compare
the two evaluations finding perfect agreement with each other, with both
real and complex masses. We can also evaluate the scalar massive box via
series expansion and also in this case we find perfect agreement. We have
studied the dependence of these functions on the value of the gauge boson
decay width, finding a regular behavior.

5. and 6.
The results of the code which performs the series expansion has been compared
with PySecDec in the non-physical euclidean region, where PySecDec provides
precise results.
We found perfect agreement within the numerical uncertainty affecting the PySecDec results.
In the physical region PySecDec has convergence problems.
We performed a detailed comparison against DiffExp with real masses.
In particular we compared the two solutions for 4 different values of sqrt(s)
(one below the MV threshold, one between the MV and 2MV ones and two above the 2MV one)
and for 2 different values of cos theta. We found agreement at the 10^-12 level.
We also performed a comparison with Ginac for the 31 integrals expressed in terms of GPLs
and evaluated with complex masses. The agreement is of order 10^-7.
The value of the last 5 integrals with complex masses is a prediction.



7. The hard virtual coefficient function H has been evaluated in 3250
points and those are used as starting point for interpolation. The binning
is finer around the Z resonance and coarser in the high mass tail; it is
uniform with respect to the scattering angle. The evaluation of H at any
intermediate point is achieved via linear interpolation of the grid values
and the relative discrepancy compared to the exact result is smaller than
0.001, understandable given the smoothness of the correction and the binning
adapted to the NLO behaviour of the distribution.
Increasing the binning to improve the accuracy of the interpolation is straightforward.
We consider our current choice sufficient for an accurate phenomenology.

8.
The numerical evaluation of the Master Integrals requires a fixed amount of time of ~60 s,
for each step of the transportation of the boundary conditions.
The number of steps necessary for evaluating one point depends
on the distance between the starting and ending point,
and on the presence of singularities that need to be avoided.
Entering the physical region, usually requires 20 steps.
The evaluation of every additional point requires a number of steps between 1 and 10.

Once the grid of the Master Integral values is ready,
the evaluation of one point of the function H takes a time of order XXX s.

Once the grid for the function H is ready, quering the interpolation function
takes a negligible amount of time (of order 0.001s).



9. We have already provided with the first submission a full grid of values,
useful as benchmarks as suggested by the Referee.

10. We provide in the text the requested values.
