Dear all,

thanks again for all your useful comments. 
We went through them together, implementing most of them,
and we submitted tonight a revised version of the manuscript to the arXiv.

The new version of the paper discusses the IR subtraction
on a more general ground.
We then introduce only the subtraction operator in the qt-subtraction formalism,
for the sake of definiteness.


Two of your comments have been overlooked, but only temporarily.

We did not present further details of our implementation of DiffExp
with complex masses, as Luca suggested.
This is because we are planning to have a dedicated publication
in the near future,
that now has been added as a reference “in preparation”.

The comment by Stefan regarding different input values or input schemes,
instead, is more cumbersome than it might seem.
The presence of multiple mass scales in the amplitude
can not be handled by a simple rescaling of the kinematical variables,
as it is the case, e.g., for top pair production.
The reader could use, in principle, the formulae in the ancillary files
to recompute the grid with any possible value of the input parameters.
The semianalytical evaluation of the 5 Master Integrals
is clearly quite demanding.
In any case, since we are providing the explicit results,
we are formally on the safe side if someone asks.

On the other hand, it could be a more practical solution to test the accuracy
of an interpolation procedure with respect to different values
of the input parameters.
This is something that we need to test,
also in view of our common future phenomenological studies.
